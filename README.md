# Pizza App
this app will allow user to login, select pizza , add them to cart , customize them ( by removing ingredients or optin for extra ).

## Main components
this app requires a server side api which i prefer to code in nodejs as it will allow me to have a faster prototyping speed 
I will use flutter on the other hand as a front because i believe it is the most efficient tool for prototyping 


## Project milestone

This project has to be broken down into several milestone:
-create the pizza with the database ( well i can hardcode 8 types but that's to impractical, i would rather create an api that allows for adding more pizzas)
-create user object to define our user 
-create order object to define orders ( keep history of past order for each user)
-Build frontend elements:
* Select pizza menu : here the user will see some pizza with the most basic info ( ie: name and price )
* Select toppign on a particular pizza, define preferences on amount of topping . Confirm 
* View cart screen : this should show all the details related to to the order
*  profile screen : on which i'll show all the data related to previous orders, 
possibly delivery address for my clients
